# Quantum Agent-Based Modeling (QABM)

This repository contains implementations of agent-based modelling simulations using the quantum agents proposed in [1].  Quantum agents exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to achieve superior entropic memory efficiency over their classical counterparts.

## Overview
The project implements three main quantum agent-based models:

1. **Actively Perturbed Coin**: A simple example described in [2] to illustrate the memory advantage provided by the quantum framework.  The agent represents a single coin with states 0 and 1, receiving a binary input $`x\in\{0,1\}`$ at each time step. In response, the agent flips the coin with probability $p$ if $x=1$ and with probability $q$ if $x=0$, where $`0 \lt p,q \lt 1`$. The agent then outputs the new state $`y\in\{0,1\}`$ of the coin.
2. **Viral Infection Model**: Simulates the spread and perpetuation of a viral infection (specifically, the Ebola virus) in a closed population with agents that can be in one of four states: sick, immune, healthy, or dead. The model is based on [this](http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Virus.nlogo) model from [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and includes mechanisms for infection spread, recovery, death, immunity loss, and reproduction.
3. **Traffic Intersection Model**: Simulates a six-lane traffic intersection with quantum-encoded lane agents and a classical traffic light control system. The model handles vehicle queuing, traffic light timing, and vehicle flow through the intersection.

## Features

- Quantum encoding of agent states using minimal memory requirements
- Hybrid quantum-classical approach for position-based simulations
- Efficient spatial querying using k-d trees for the viral infection model
- Probabilistic vehicle arrival and departure modeling for the traffic simulation
- Analysis tools for computing quantum and classical entropy metrics
- Visualization capabilities for simulation results

## Results

The implementation demonstrates significant memory compression for the traffic intersection model:
- 32.4% improvement for lanes 1 & 4
- 40.5% improvement for lanes 2 & 5
- 20.3% improvement for lanes 3 & 6

The viral infection model shows minimal quantum advantage due to the near-orthogonality of its memory states.
