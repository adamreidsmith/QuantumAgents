# Quantum Agent-Based Modeling (QABM)

This repository contains implementations of agent-based modelling simulations using the quantum agents proposed in [1].  Quantum agents exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to achieve superior entropic memory efficiency over their classical counterparts.

## Overview
The project implements three main quantum agent-based models:

1. **Actively Perturbed Coin**: A simple example described in [2] to illustrate the memory advantage provided by the quantum framework.  The agent represents a single coin with states 0 and 1, receiving a binary input $`x\in\{0,1\}`$ at each time step. In response, the agent flips the coin with probability $p$ if $x=1$ and with probability $q$ if $x=0$, where $`0 \lt p,q \lt 1`$. The agent then outputs the new state $`y\in\{0,1\}`$ of the coin.
2. **Viral Infection Model**: Simulates the spread and perpetuation of a viral infection (specifically, the Ebola virus) in a closed population with agents that can be in one of four states: sick, immune, healthy, or dead. The model is based on [this](http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Virus.nlogo) model from [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and includes mechanisms for infection spread, recovery, death, immunity loss, and reproduction.
3. **Traffic Intersection Model**: Simulates the six-lane traffic intersection of figure 1 with quantum-encoded lane agents and a classical traffic light control system. The model handles vehicle queuing, traffic light timing, and vehicle flow through the intersection.

- Visualization capabilities for simulation results

## Model Parameters

| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | 
| $p_{recover}$ | Daily probability of recovery | 0.05 |
| $p_{die}$ | Daily probability of death for infected | 0.05 |
| $`p_{lose\_immunity}`$ | Daily probability of losing immunity | 0.00027 |
| $p_{infect}$ | Probability of infection on contact | 0.8 |
| $`p_{random\_infect}`$ | Daily probability of random infection | $`5.5\cdot 10 ^{-6}`$ |
| $p_{reproduce} | Daily probability of reproduction | 0.0003 |

## Results

Figure 2 shows the theoretical and computed transition probabilities for the actively perturbed coin, confirming that the quantum encoding accurately replicates the classical model.

Figure 3 shows the number of agents occupying each state throughout a 100-year simulation of the viral infection model. Outbreaks are clearly evident by the spikes in the population of sick agents and the corresponding drops in the number of healthy agents.

Figure 4 shows the distributions of queue length and wait times between green lights for a 250,000-light cycle simulation of the intersection model. Each lane accumulates a similar queue length between green lights, however, the lower vehicle arrival rates of lanes 3 and 6 lead to higher wait times.

The implementation demonstrates significant memory compression for the traffic intersection model:
- 32.4% improvement for lanes 1 & 4
- 40.5% improvement for lanes 2 & 5
- 20.3% improvement for lanes 3 & 6

The viral infection model shows minimal quantum advantage (approximately 0.0015%) due to the near-orthogonality of its memory states.
